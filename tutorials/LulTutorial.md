The **Lia-UI-Library** (LUL for short) can create procedural
UI, and has features like buttons, radio, and input fields.  
This guide will show you how to use it in a LiaScript-Course,
however, many steps are the same when using it in an external website.


## Preparation

In order to use the LUL, you might need to import some or all of the following files
into your course:
* ` lul.js ` and ` lul.css ` (you will definetly need those)
* ` consys.js ` and ` consys.css ` (if you want to use [ containers ]{@tutorial ConsysTutorial})
* ` base.js ` (absolutely needed)
* ` lul-lia-bridge.js ` (to ensure that the colors are matching those of the LiaScript course; omit on external website)

Your course might initially look like this:

# My first LiaScript Course

<div id="myDiv"></div>

```

Notice the ` myScript.js ` tag. This is were we will be putting all example code in.


## Basic Usage

Put the following code into your script:

```
let button = genButton({
  text: "Click me!",
  onclick: function() {
    alert("Thank you!");
  }
});

set("myDiv", button);
```

When you reload your course, you should see a black button appear that wants you to click on it.

You may have noticed that the function ` genButton()`, which returns an HTML-Button,Ã¼
does not take its two arguments directly, but rather as object.
This helps making the code be more readable.  
More information can be found [ here ]{@tutorial arg}

So we can see that ` genButton() ` handles both the Text of the button as well as
its behaviour.

The second function used in this example was ` set()`. Its effect is to set the new **button** 
as child of the div **"myDiv"**, which we declared in our LiaMarkdown above. Without it,
we would not see the button.


### Keys

So, in the previous example, we used ` set("myDiv", button); ` to place one HTML-Element inside
another HTML-Element, yet one argument is a string and the other one the Element itself.  
It might seem peculiar to  use two different data types representing the same kind of object.

In reality however these alternatives (for example) would have worked as well:

```
store(button, "button");
set("myDiv", "button");
```

```
let myDiv = get("myDiv");
set(myDiv, button);
```

```
button.setAttribute("id", "button");
let myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv"); 
set(myDiv, "button");
```

Arguments that are handled this way are called [ keys ]{@tutorial key}.


## Configuration

The example of the last chapter gave us a black button, since that color is the default.
We can change the default colors by putting the following somewhere in our script:

```
//create a config object with all default values
let newLulConfig = new LulConfig();

//modify the values that interest us
```
