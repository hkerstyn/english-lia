## Introduction

This is the documentation for
* the **LUL** (Lia-UI-Library)
* its dependencies (the **consys** and **base** library)
* the **Youtube Grabber** script


### The LUL

The [ Lia-UI-Library ]{@tutorial LulTutorial} was designed to procedurally generate UI  
such as buttons, input fields, and text.


### The Consys Library

**Consys** stands for **Container System**.  
Like the Base Library,
this library is designed to work
as dependency of the LUL,
however, it can also be used on its own.

It provides the {@link Container} class,
that can be used for creating and moving
tiling-wm-like containers.


### The Base Library

The [ Base Library ]{@tutorial BaseLibrary} provides
a rather diverse bunch of
useful functions and shorthands.


### The Grabber

The YouTube Grabber is a small tool
that enables the user to
read and analyse the subtitle transcript of a YouTube video.


## Getting started

So, there are several things that you would want to know about,
depending on your intentions.

You might want to
* use any (or all) of the above libraries on some website
* use them inside LiaScript
* modify the source code

See [ How to import all libraries to your Website ]{@tutorial ScriptImport}

Furthermore, you might be interested in learning the usage of
* the [ LUL ]{@tutorial LulTutorial}
* the [ consys library ]{@tutorial ConsysTutorial}
* or the [ base library ]{@tutorial BaseLibrary}
